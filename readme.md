# library Lender

## Introduction

Welcome the library lender project.  The idea and general purpose of this project is to allow others to connect through their love of books.  Be it freinds, family or to make new freinds this is designed around books.  Each user creates their own personal id which is how they are referenced on the site *similiar to all other social sites*.  Once an account is created, that is were the real fun happens.  There are several things that a user can do:

- List books that they are reading or are in their library.  A social site around books, only works if people know what you are reading.  Here you can list what is in your current library, and also star what you are currently reading.
- review books.  Read a great book?  Great, then share it with the world.  You can reveiw books that you liked, and you didnt like.  This is not designed for bashing, so please keep all your critiques clean and constrcutive.
- lend a book.  We give you the ability to lend books to your freinds and neighbors.  See a book you have thought about reading?  Here you can see if somone else has the same book, and would be willing to lend it to you.  All users can have a review attached to them, so you can see before you decide to lend just how good a person they are.
- attend/create a book club.  socialiality, books and book clubs go together like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  At library lender we allow you the ability to create your own book clubs.  Also, if you see a club that looks interesting you can join in the discussion.  Their are two types of books club, public and private.  If a club is private it can only be joined with a specific request, else anyone can look for a public club.  However, a public can be restricted where you need permission to join.
- make a new freind.  At library lender we encourage freindship.  You are able to search by title, author or genre to see who else is reading the same book, or has similar interests.
